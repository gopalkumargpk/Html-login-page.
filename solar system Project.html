        <li>
            The universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years old, based on the ages of the oldest stars and the rate of expansion.
        </li>
        <li>
            The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter,
            based on the distance light travels at 300,000 kilometers per second since the Big Bang.
        </li>
        <li>
            The universe is made up of three types of matter: normal matter, dark matter, and dark energy. 
            Normal matter is made up of atoms that make up stars, planets, humans, and other visible objects.
            Dark matter makes up 27% of the universe and influences gravitational forces, 
            while dark energy makes up 68% and accelerates the universe's expansion.

            Why is it Called The "Solar System?"
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are many planetary systems in the universe, with planets orbiting host stars. 
            Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar”
            to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."

        <li>
            The sun is a star that is the center of our solar system and provides Earth with heat, light, and energy.
            It's a huge, glowing ball of hot gas that appears larger and brighter than other stars because we're so close to it. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
            It's located in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, about 26,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy.
        </li>

        <li>
            It orbits the center of the Milky Way once every 230 million years
        </li>
        <li>
            It has a radius of 695,700 kilometers and a temperature of 5,973°C to 15,000,000°C.
        </li>

        <li>
            The sun is extremely important to our planet. It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis.
            Without the sun's heat and light, life on Earth would not exist.
